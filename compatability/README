This directory contains files that can be referenced with the -pf flag to emulate
a protocol version other than what is implemented in SMProxy.  This can be used so
that you may use the latest features of SMProxy and still debug older protocol versions.

For example, if you wish to use SMProxy with Minecraft 1.1, use the following syntax:

SMProxy.exe -pf minecraft-1.1.txt [server address]

If you'd like to provide a compatabilty layer for a different protocol version, please
contact SirCmpwn on FreeNode IRC, or send an email to sir@cmpwn.com.

"cross-version" files enable different versions of the protocol to interact with each
other.
